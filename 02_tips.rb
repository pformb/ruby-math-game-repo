=begin
This project will contain multiple classes. 
Each class should be defined in its own rb file. 
You should not put any other code outside the class 
definition
=end 

# Use gets.chomp to get input from users and puts for output

=begin Isolate your I/O logic to one or two classes. Don't allow 
all your classes to interact (gets/puts) with the User
=end
=begin Remember to build incrementally, writing small amounts of 
runnable code instead of writing out a whole bunch of classes/methods 
that are not yet testable/runnable.
=end

# Use puts, raise some_val.inspect, and byebug to help with debugging
